## 🗄️ **Database Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Setup Production Supabase Database
```bash
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
# 2. Create a new project for production
# 3. Go to SQL Editor
# 4. Run the enhanced schema setup:
```

Execute the SQL from `/app/lib/supabase-global-likes-setup.sql`:
- Creates `bar_likes` table for global like tracking
- Creates `user_achievements` table with popup history
- Enhances `user_profiles` with XP, level, and stats
- Adds database functions for analytics
- Sets up proper indexes and RLS policies

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Create `.env` file in project root:
```env
# Production Supabase Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key

# Get these from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
```
