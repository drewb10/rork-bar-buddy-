# üöÄ Quick Supabase Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Fix "Database error saving new user"

If you're getting the error "Database error saving new user", this is caused by restrictive RLS policies. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Run the Latest RLS Policy Fix
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250625003000_fix_rls_policy_final.sql`
4. Paste it and click "Run"
5. You should see "RLS policy test successful - signup should now work"

## Step 2: Verify Your Current RLS Policies
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication ‚Üí Policies
2. Find the `profiles` table
3. You should see these policies:
   - ‚úÖ "Allow profile creation during signup" (INSERT)
   - ‚úÖ "Allow viewing all profiles" (SELECT)  
   - ‚úÖ "Allow users to update own profile" (UPDATE)
   - ‚úÖ "Allow users to delete own profile" (DELETE)

## Step 3: Remove Problematic Policies
If you see this policy, **DELETE IT**:
```sql
‚ùå "Allow users to insert their own profile" with check ((select auth.uid()) = id)
```

This policy prevents signup because `auth.uid()` is not available during the signup process.

## Step 4: Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon/Public Key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`)

## Step 5: Create Your .env File
1. In your project root, create a file called `.env` (no extension)
2. Copy this content and replace with your actual values:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
```

## Step 6: Restart Your App
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Step 7: Test Signup
1. Try creating a new account
2. If it works, go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor
3. Check the `profiles` table - you should see your data

## üîß Why This Error Happens

The "Database error saving new user" occurs because:

1. **Restrictive RLS Policy**: The policy `(select auth.uid()) = id` fails during signup
2. **Timing Issue**: `auth.uid()` is not available when the profile is being created
3. **Supabase Auth Flow**: Auth user is created first, then profile, but RLS blocks it

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution

1. **Permissive INSERT Policy**: Allow anyone to create profiles (needed for signup)
2. **Proper UPDATE/DELETE Policies**: Restrict to own profiles after signup
3. **No Foreign Key Constraints**: Avoid cascade issues
4. **Manual Relationship Management**: Handle user-profile relationship in app code

## Common Errors & Solutions

### "Database error saving new user"
**Solution:** Run the RLS policy fix migration `20250625003000_fix_rls_policy_final.sql`

### "Supabase not configured"
**Solution:** Create `.env` file with correct credentials

### "Connection failed"
**Solution:** Check your internet connection and Supabase project status

### "Username is already taken"
